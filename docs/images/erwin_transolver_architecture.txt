# Architecture Diagram for HAET with Transolver++

This is a placeholder for the enhanced architecture diagram. Replace this file with an actual diagram showing:

1. Input mesh processing
2. Rep-Slice with adaptive temperature (Ada-Temp)
3. Eidetic states creation and processing
4. Virtual spatial embedding
5. Hierarchical ball attention with ErwinTransformer
6. De-slicing operation
7. Output processing

The diagram should illustrate how Transolver++ and Erwin components are integrated, highlighting the memory efficiency gained through eidetic states and the computational efficiency from ball attention.
