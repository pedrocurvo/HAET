Welcome to HAET Documentation!
===================================

**HAET** (Hierarchical Attention Erwin Transolver) is an advanced neural architecture for solving complex physics problems on mesh structures.
It combines Transolver's token slicing approach with Erwin's hierarchical ball attention mechanism to efficiently process mesh data at multiple scales.

The architecture addresses key limitations in both original approaches:

* Replaces Transolver's quadratic attention complexity with more efficient hierarchical ball attention
* Extends Erwin's capability to handle larger and more complex meshes

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for installation and usage instructions, and the :doc:`architecture` section for details on how the model works.
The :doc:`api` section provides documentation for the core modules and classes.
